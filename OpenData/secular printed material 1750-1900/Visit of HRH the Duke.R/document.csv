Manx,English,Notes
Yn Theay Vannin fieaur er dy hon dy Chuyrt vea dty vein rein. [1],The Manx public waits for you to send a welcome to your queen.,"[1] This looks as if it has been transcribed poorly, for ‘fieaur’, read ‘fieau’ and for ‘dy’ read ‘dty’. As one would expect the Duke of Edinburgh to be addressed with the second person plural it should read, perhaps; Ta’n Theay Vannin fieau er nyn son dy choyrt vea da nyn ven-reïn’—'the Manx public are waiting for you to send greetings to your / their queen’."
Shee dy vea dys sosthyns shultayr Prince,Welcome to England’s sailor prince.[2],[2] This grammatically incorrect and is evidently not Native Manx.
Dy bannee Jee yn vein rein,May God bless the queen.,
"Shee dy Yea Mannin[3]—Shee Yee dy row merriu,",Welcome to the Isle of Man—May God’s peace be with you.,"[3] Should read, perhaps, ‘She dy vea dys Mannin’."
"Ta Shin Coyrt oltaghey creeoil dhyts,",We give you a hearty welcome.[4],[4] The usage of the familiar pronoun here suggests this was not produced by a native speaker.
Ben-rein Ellan Vannin.,Queen of the Isle of Man.,
